## Description

A network switch is a Layer 2 (Data Link) device that forwards frames based on MAC addresses within a local network. Modern switches may also include Layer 3 capabilities.

## Key Functions

- MAC address learning
- Frame forwarding
- Collision domain separation
- VLAN support
- Port security

## Switch Types

### Unmanaged Switch
- Plug-and-play
- No configuration
- Basic functionality
- Consumer/small office

### Managed Switch
- Full configuration capability
- VLAN support
- Port security
- SNMP monitoring
- Enterprise use

### Layer 3 Switch
- Routing capabilities
- Inter-VLAN routing
- Faster than router for LAN
- Cost-effective for large networks

## Security Features

### Port Security
- Limit MAC addresses per port
- Prevent MAC flooding
- Sticky MAC learning

### VLAN Support
- Network segmentation
- Broadcast domain separation
- Security zones

### Other Features
- DHCP snooping
- Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI)
- IP Source Guard
- 802.1X authentication
- Storm control
