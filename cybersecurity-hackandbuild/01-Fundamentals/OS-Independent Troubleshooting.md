## Description

OS-independent troubleshooting refers to diagnostic techniques and problem-solving approaches that work across different operating systems. These skills focus on hardware-level and universal concepts rather than OS-specific tools.

## Key Concepts

### Universal Troubleshooting Methodology
1. **Identify the problem**: Gather information, symptoms
2. **Establish theory**: Determine probable cause
3. **Test theory**: Verify the hypothesis
4. **Establish action plan**: Determine steps to resolve
5. **Implement solution**: Execute the fix
6. **Verify functionality**: Confirm problem is solved
7. **Document**: Record the issue and resolution

### Hardware-Level Diagnostics
- POST (Power-On Self-Test) indicators
- BIOS/UEFI troubleshooting
- Hardware diagnostics tools
- Cable and connection testing
- Power supply issues

### Common Cross-Platform Issues
- Boot failures
- Hardware compatibility
- Driver problems
- Network connectivity
- Performance degradation

## Security Relevance

- Identifying compromised systems
- Distinguishing between technical failures and security incidents
- Root cause analysis for security events
- Understanding system behavior anomalies
