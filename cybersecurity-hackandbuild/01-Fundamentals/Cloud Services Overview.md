## Description

Cloud services provide on-demand access to computing resources, storage, and applications over the internet. Understanding cloud computing is essential for modern cybersecurity professionals.

## Key Concepts

### Major Cloud Providers
- **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**: Market leader, comprehensive services
- **Microsoft Azure**: Enterprise integration, hybrid cloud
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**: Data analytics, machine learning
- **iCloud**: Apple's consumer cloud service
- **Google Suite**: Google Workspace for collaboration
- **MS Office Suite**: Microsoft 365 cloud offering

### Service Models
- **IaaS** (Infrastructure as a Service): Virtual machines, storage, networks
- **PaaS** (Platform as a Service): Development platforms, databases
- **SaaS** (Software as a Service): Applications delivered over internet

### Deployment Models
- **Public Cloud**: Shared infrastructure, multi-tenant
- **Private Cloud**: Dedicated infrastructure, single organization
- **Hybrid Cloud**: Combination of public and private
- **Multi-Cloud**: Using multiple cloud providers

## Security Considerations

### Shared Responsibility Model
- **Cloud Provider**: Physical security, infrastructure, hypervisor
- **Customer**: Data, applications, access management, OS patching

### Common Security Concerns
- **Data breaches**: Unauthorized access to cloud data
- **Misconfiguration**: Publicly exposed storage buckets
- **Account hijacking**: Compromised credentials
- **API vulnerabilities**: Insecure interfaces
- **Insider threats**: Malicious cloud administrators

### Cloud Security Tools
- Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)
- Cloud Access Security Brokers (CASB)
- Cloud Workload Protection Platforms (CWPP)
