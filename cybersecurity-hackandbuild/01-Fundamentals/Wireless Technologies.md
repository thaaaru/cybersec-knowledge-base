## Description

Wireless technologies enable device communication without physical cables. Understanding these technologies is crucial for securing modern networks and devices.

## Key Concepts

### WiFi (802.11 Standards)
- **802.11a/b/g/n/ac/ax**: Different WiFi generations
- **Frequency bands**: 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz
- **Security protocols**: WEP, WPA, WPA2, WPA3
- **SSID and broadcasting**
- **Access points and routers**

### Bluetooth
- Short-range wireless communication
- Pairing and bonding mechanisms
- Bluetooth versions and profiles
- BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy)

### NFC (Near Field Communication)
- Very short-range communication (< 4 cm)
- Contactless payments
- Access control systems
- Device pairing

### Infrared (IR)
- Line-of-sight communication
- Remote controls
- Legacy technology
- Limited modern use

## Security Considerations

### WiFi Security
- **Encryption**: Always use WPA3 or WPA2 minimum
- **Hidden SSIDs**: Security through obscurity (limited effectiveness)
- **MAC filtering**: Additional access control layer
- **Guest networks**: Network segmentation
- **Rogue access points**: Unauthorized APs on network

### Bluetooth Security
- **Bluejacking**: Sending unsolicited messages
- **Bluesnarfing**: Unauthorized access to device data
- **BlueSmishing**: SMS phishing via Bluetooth
- **Pairing vulnerabilities**: Man-in-the-middle attacks

### NFC Security
- **Eavesdropping**: Intercepting NFC communications
- **Relay attacks**: Extending NFC range
- **Data modification**: Altering transmitted data
