## Description

Vulnerability management is a continuous, proactive security practice focused on identifying, evaluating, treating, and reporting on security vulnerabilities in systems and software. It represents a systematic approach to discovering weaknesses in an organization's infrastructure before attackers can exploit them. This practice goes beyond simple vulnerability scanning to encompass the entire lifecycle of vulnerability handling, from discovery through remediation and verification.

The modern threat landscape makes vulnerability management essential for any organization. New vulnerabilities are discovered daily, with thousands added to databases like the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) each year. Without a structured approach to managing these weaknesses, organizations face increased risk of data breaches, system compromises, and compliance violations. Effective vulnerability management reduces the attack surface and provides measurable improvements in security posture.

A mature vulnerability management program operates on multiple levels simultaneously. It includes automated vulnerability scanning, manual security assessments, threat intelligence integration, risk-based prioritization, and coordinated remediation efforts. The program must balance the urgency of addressing critical vulnerabilities with the operational reality that not every vulnerability can or should be patched immediately. This requires sophisticated risk assessment capabilities and strong collaboration between security, IT operations, and business stakeholders.

Successful vulnerability management is not a one-time project but an ongoing process that adapts to evolving threats and changing infrastructure. It requires appropriate tooling, skilled personnel, clear processes, executive support, and integration with other security practices like [[Penetration Testing]], [[Threat Hunting]], and [[Incident Response Process]]. Organizations that excel at vulnerability management can significantly reduce their exposure to cyber threats and demonstrate due diligence to regulators and customers.

## The Vulnerability Management Lifecycle

### 1. Discovery (Asset Identification)
**Objective**: Know what assets exist in your environment

**Activities**:
- Network scanning and enumeration
- Asset inventory management
- Cloud resource discovery
- Shadow IT identification
- Software inventory tracking
- Configuration management database (CMDB) maintenance

**Tools**:
- [[nmap]] for network discovery
- Asset management platforms
- Cloud security posture management (CSPM) tools
- Endpoint management solutions

**Challenges**:
- Dynamic environments (cloud, containers)
- Remote workforce endpoints
- Shadow IT and unauthorized devices
- Incomplete asset databases

### 2. Assessment (Vulnerability Detection)
**Objective**: Identify vulnerabilities across all assets

**Scanning Types**:
- **Authenticated Scans**: Use credentials to deeply inspect systems
- **Unauthenticated Scans**: External perspective without credentials
- **Agent-Based Scans**: Continuous monitoring via installed agents
- **Network Scans**: Identify network-level vulnerabilities
- **Application Scans**: Web application and API security testing
- **Container Scans**: Image and runtime container vulnerabilities
- **Cloud Configuration Scans**: Misconfiguration detection

**Scanning Tools**:
- Tenable Nessus
- Qualys VMDR
- Rapid7 InsightVM
- OpenVAS (open source)
- Nuclei (open source)

**Best Practices**:
- Schedule regular scanning (weekly or more frequently)
- Use both authenticated and unauthenticated scans
- Scan all environments (production, staging, development)
- Minimize scan impact on production systems
- Maintain up-to-date vulnerability signatures

### 3. Prioritization (Risk Assessment)
**Objective**: Determine which vulnerabilities pose the greatest risk

**Prioritization Factors**:
- **Severity Score**: CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) rating
- **Exploitability**: Availability of exploit code or active exploitation
- **Asset Criticality**: Importance of affected system to business
- **Exposure**: Internet-facing vs. internal systems
- **Data Sensitivity**: Type of data accessible through vulnerability
- **Compensating Controls**: Existing mitigations in place
- **Threat Intelligence**: Real-world exploitation activity

**Risk-Based Prioritization**:
```
Risk Score = (Vulnerability Severity × Asset Value × Threat Level) / Compensating Controls
```

**Common Prioritization Frameworks**:
- CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System)
- EPSS (Exploit Prediction Scoring System)
- SSVC (Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization)
- VPR (Vulnerability Priority Rating)

**Reality Check**:
Not all "Critical" CVSS scores require immediate patching. Consider:
- Is the vulnerable service actually running?
- Is the vulnerable function being used?
- Are there network controls limiting access?
- What is the business impact of patching vs. not patching?

### 4. Remediation (Vulnerability Treatment)
**Objective**: Address vulnerabilities through various treatment options

**Remediation Options**:

**Patching**:
- Apply vendor security updates
- Test patches in non-production first
- Schedule maintenance windows
- Implement emergency patching for critical issues
- Document all patch activities

**Configuration Changes**:
- Harden system configurations
- Disable unnecessary services
- Apply security baselines
- Implement secure defaults

**Compensating Controls**:
- Firewall rules to restrict access
- Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules
- Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) signatures
- Network segmentation
- Additional authentication requirements

**Workarounds**:
- Temporary measures until patches available
- Procedural controls
- Alternative configurations

**Risk Acceptance**:
- Formal documentation of accepted risks
- Executive approval required
- Regular re-evaluation
- Clear justification (e.g., legacy system being decommissioned)

**Service Decommissioning**:
- Remove vulnerable systems no longer needed
- Migrate to secure alternatives

**Remediation SLAs** (Example):
- Critical (CVSS 9.0-10.0): 7 days
- High (CVSS 7.0-8.9): 30 days
- Medium (CVSS 4.0-6.9): 90 days
- Low (CVSS 0.1-3.9): 180 days or next maintenance window

### 5. Verification (Validation)
**Objective**: Confirm vulnerabilities have been properly addressed

**Verification Methods**:
- Re-scan previously vulnerable assets
- Manual testing of remediation
- Configuration audits
- Penetration testing validation
- Compensating control verification

**Documentation**:
- Record remediation actions taken
- Document verification results
- Update risk registers
- Close tickets in tracking systems

### 6. Reporting (Communication)
**Objective**: Communicate vulnerability status to stakeholders

**Report Types**:

**Technical Reports**:
- Detailed vulnerability findings
- Remediation instructions
- Technical risk analysis
- Scan results and trends

**Management Reports**:
- Executive summary of risk posture
- Remediation progress metrics
- Compliance status
- Resource allocation needs
- Trend analysis

**Compliance Reports**:
- Evidence of vulnerability management activities
- Demonstration of due diligence
- Audit trail documentation

**Key Metrics to Report**:
- Total vulnerabilities by severity
- Mean time to remediate (MTTR)
- Percentage of systems scanned
- Vulnerability density (vulnerabilities per asset)
- Remediation rate
- SLA compliance
- Trend over time (improving or degrading)
