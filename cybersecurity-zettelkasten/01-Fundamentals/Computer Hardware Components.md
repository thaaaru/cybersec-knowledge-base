## Description

Understanding computer hardware components is the foundation of IT and cybersecurity knowledge. This includes physical infrastructure, device connectivity, and how different components interact to form a functional computing system.

## Key Concepts

- **Physical Infrastructure**: Servers, workstations, network devices
- **Core Components**: CPU, RAM, storage devices, motherboard, power supply
- **Peripheral Devices**: Input/output devices, external storage
- **Device Connectivity**: How components connect and communicate
- **Hardware Function**: Understanding what each component does

## Security Relevance

- Hardware vulnerabilities (e.g., Spectre, Meltdown)
- Physical security considerations
- Hardware-based attacks (USB drops, hardware keyloggers)
- Secure boot and TPM modules
- Understanding attack surface at hardware level
