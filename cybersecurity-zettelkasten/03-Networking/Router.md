A router is a Layer 3 (Network layer) device that forwards packets between networks based on IP addresses. It's essential for inter-network communication and the internet.

## Key Functions

- Routes packets between different networks
- Determines best path using routing protocols
- Connects LANs to WANs
- NAT and firewall capabilities
- Traffic filtering with ACLs

## Routing Types

### Static Routing
- Manually configured routes
- Predictable, no overhead
- Good for small networks
- Doesn't adapt to changes

### Dynamic Routing
- Automated route learning
- Adapts to topology changes
- Protocols: RIP, OSPF, EIGRP, BGP

## Security Features

- Access Control Lists (ACLs)
- Packet filtering
- NAT/PAT
- VPN termination
- Logging and monitoring
